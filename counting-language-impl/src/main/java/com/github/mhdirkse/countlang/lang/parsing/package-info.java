/**
 * This package parses a program written in the counting-language language. Class
 * {@link ParseEntryPoint} is the entry point. It calls ANTLR to parse the language.
 * To ANTLR it provides a listener implemented in the generated class
 * {@link CountlangListenerDelegator}. That class delegates to a chain of handlers
 * generated by the codegenPlugin plugin. These handlers have the same
 * methods as the ANTLR 4 generated class {@link com.github.mhdirkse.countlang.lang.CountlangListener}.
 * {@link CountlangListenerDelegator} calls the registered handlers from first to last until
 * a handler returns true. If no handler does so, an exception is thrown.
 * {@link ParseEntryPoint} starts by providing a {@link RootHandler} and a {@link IgnoredMethodsHandler}.
 * The first of these collects the AST, while the last ensures that irrelevant ANTLR 4 calls are handled.
 * For each languague element, a handler is added that creates the related AST node.
 * <p>
