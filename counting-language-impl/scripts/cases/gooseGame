# This case study is about the game of the goose. There is a board
# with 63 numbered fields and in addition a start field. At the start
# of the game, you have a colored pawn at the start field. You play
# the game by throwing two dice. The total determines how much
# fields you can advance your pawn. You win when your pawn reaches
# the end field 63. See
# https://howdoyouplayit.com/game-of-the-goose-rules-how-do-you-play-game-of-the-goose/
# 
# Let us first simplify the game as much as possible, as follows:
# i) We consider only one goose.
# ii) All fields are treated like normal fields.
# iii) We skip the rule that a goose has to walk back if he does not land
#      on square 63 exactly. In our simplification for example, the game
#      ends on the next turn if a goose is at field 61. Any dice roll
#      of two or more is enough to reach 63.
#
# Before we start, we calculate the probability distribution for a
# dice roll.

experiment expTwoDice() {
  sample d1 from distribution 1:6;

# print diceRoll;

# We want to know how many turns it take to finish. We set up a Markov chain
# with a two-valued state: We have the number of turns played so far and the
# current field.

# This results in beautiful display of large numbers, but it is not very
# helpful. We know that we are ending on face 63, so we can omit that.
# And we do not need the exact numbers, but floating-point approximations.

# Only the values 7 - 13 inclusive have a probability of more than
# one permille. The expected value for the number of turns is 9.49.
# This value is not surprising. The expected value for throwing one
# dice is 3 + 1/2. Two dice have an expected value of 7. We are
# aiming for field 63, and 63 / 7 = 9.

# Next, we make it more complicated by omitting our third simplification.
# Like in the real game, a goose has to move back if it does not reach
# face 63 exactly.

# The maximum number of turns considered is 274. We can test our
# stop criterion as follows. The next number of rounds being considered
# is 275. An upper bound for the probability for this number of rounds
# is the probability we see for unknown: 983.5E-12. Dividing by the
# expectation for the number of rounds produces an upper bound for the
# residual: 1.3E-8. This is indeed more than the threshold we applied:
# 1E-9.
#
# The game of the goose takes much longer if gooses have to walk back from
# field 63 with excess dice rolls. The expected number of rounds has
# become 20.94 instead of 9.49.

# It would be interesting to lift more restrictions. We could introduce
# the goose death, that throws back goose to the start field. And we could
# introduce the prison, which a goose can only leave if another goose
# enters the prison. However, this requires much code. In practice,
# counting-language needs to be extended with features for unit testing
# before this is feasible.
